New Ajaxterm
============

Ajaxterm is a web based terminal. Orignally written by Antony Lesuisse. It was totally inspired and works almost
exactly like http://anyterm.org/ except it's much easier to install.

TODO
====

* Use Coffee Script
* remove qweb and sarissa.js
* Better styling
* Better keyboard handling.
* Automatic resizing.
